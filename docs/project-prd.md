# Product Requirements Document (PRD): OSDU MCP Server

## Intro

The OSDU MCP Server provides AI-powered tooling through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by leveraging proven architectural patterns from the OSDU CLI codebase as a development accelerator. The server implements independent MCP tools that reuse CLI concepts for authentication, configuration, error handling, and API interactions while being optimized for AI workflows and MCP protocol requirements.

This is a **multi-phase product** with each phase producing a detailed implementation specification. The current document defines the complete product vision while individual specs will detail specific implementation phases.

## Goals and Context

### Project Objectives
* Leverage proven OSDU CLI architecture patterns as a development accelerator
* Create independent MCP tools that don't require CLI installation
* Reuse established patterns for configuration, authentication, and error handling
* Provide AI-optimized tools that complement and extend OSDU platform capabilities
* Enable seamless integration between OSDU platform and modern AI tooling
* Deliver value incrementally through phased implementation

### Key Success Criteria
* All MCP tools use consistent patterns derived from CLI architecture
* Authentication and configuration systems achieve CLI-level reliability
* Error handling follows CLI patterns for consistency and clarity
* Tools operate independently without requiring CLI installation
* Performance matches or exceeds direct API usage patterns
* Each implementation phase delivers validated, production-ready capabilities

## Product Architecture Strategy

### Core Design Philosophy
**Extract Patterns, Build Independently**: Use CLI architectural concepts and proven patterns as an accelerator while creating independent MCP tools optimized for AI workflows.

### Implementation Approach
```
CLI Pattern Analysis → Independent MCP Implementation → Phased Spec Development → Validated Tools
```

1. **Pattern Extraction**: Study and extract proven patterns from CLI codebase
2. **Independent Implementation**: Create standalone tools using extracted patterns
3. **AI Optimization**: Design tools specifically for AI workflows and MCP requirements
4. **Phased Development**: Deliver through multiple validated specifications

## Multi-Specification Strategy

### Specification Management

Each implementation phase produces a detailed specification document:

1. **Spec Creation Trigger**: When phase requirements are finalized and dependencies validated
2. **Spec Validation**: Each spec must pass comprehensive validation before next phase begins
3. **Spec Evolution**: Specifications may be updated based on implementation learnings
4. **Cross-Spec Dependencies**: Later specs build on validated earlier implementations

@mcp.tool()
@handle_osdu_exceptions
async def tool_name(
    required_param: str,
    optional_param: bool = True
) -> dict:
    """Tool description optimized for AI understanding."""
    
    # CLI-inspired client usage
    client = get_osdu_client()
    
    # Consistent error handling
    try:
        result = await client.service.operation(required_param)
        
        # AI-specific formatting
        if optional_param:
            result = format_for_ai_consumption(result)
            
        return ToolResult(
